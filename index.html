        I denied it.

      <p>Hey There, Welcome to my Home page üôèüèª</p>
      <p>
        My Name is Jay Tillu and I am a Software Developer by Profession, Tech
        Enthucist by Passion and Content Creator by hobby. I have been coding
        for more than 3 years now. When it comes to coding, I specialize in
        React, NextJs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS and Appwrite. In past,
        I have worked with many companies and on various roles such as Team
        Member Operations, Flutter Developer and Frontend Developer. These days,
        I am working at Frontend Developer at Simple2Call. As a hobby, I love to
        write about Technology, I authored more than 120 Blogs on various
        platforms including Medium, Hashnode and Dev.to. Till date my blogs
        served more than 500K+ readers worldwide, crazy right üò±?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we have already complicated the front end too much, so I am
        opting for a simpler solution for my home page and this is one of the
        fastest web page on the internet.

      <h2>You are here for...</h2>

      <p>
        In my last 3 years of experience in technology, I have learned so much
        more than any book will ever teach me. I think you are here to get to
        know me. Best way is to start with my work.

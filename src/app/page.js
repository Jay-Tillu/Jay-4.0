          When the world around me believed that a formal degree was all I
          needed, I denied it.

        <p>Hey There, Welcome to my Home page üôèüèª</p>
        <br />

        <p>
          My Name is Jay Tillu and I am a Software Developer by Profession, Tech
          Enthucist by Passion and Content Creator by hobby. I have been coding
          for more than 3 years now. When it comes to coding, I specialize in
          React, NextJs, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS and Appwrite. In
          past, I have worked with many companies and on various roles such as
          Team Member Operations, Flutter Developer and Frontend Developer.
          These days, I am working at Frontend Developer at Simple2Call. As a
          hobby, I love to write about Technology, I authored more than 120
          Blogs on various platforms including Medium, Hashnode and Dev.to. Till
          date my blogs served more than 500K+ readers worldwide, crazy right
          üò±?

          I think we have already complicated the front end too much, so I am
          opting for a simpler solution for my home page and this is one of the
          fastest web page on the internet.
        </p>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div>
        <h2>You are here for...</h2>
        <br />

        <p>
          In my last 3 years of experience in technology, I have learned so much
          more than any book will ever teach me. I think you are here to get to
          know me. Best way is to start with my work.
